Welcome to my Blog

I talk about what I am working on

I talk about my plans

I am just a programmer btw and I love vim, Linux and vim

- I have an old 4GB RAM HP Laptop
- I have decided to install ubuntu server on it
- that distro kicked my ass
- I got humbled by wifi connectivity
- i also learned that that distro might be a bit limiting anway
- I then went ahead and installed ubuntu desktop
- Then I am still going to use this laptop as my server mainly
- this laptop does not even have a screen for some reason
- it only works when plugged in to power
- i happen to have a monitor sitting around, so yeah.
- the other reason is that when i tried to get a platforn to host the backend of a system i am working on
- I didnt get a simple and free platform
- when i went to check there by your AWS, GCP, and AZUREs...I had to provide with my card details.
- the problem was........My card's expired and I have to go to the branch to get a new one
- so i decided i am going to host this thing and other projects on my own cloud.

- I use Kali as my daily
- today i had to learn to ssh into the hp(ubuntu)
- it was a fairly easy and straight forward process
- now i can work on ubuntu terminal from kali
- this is fun
- so far
- I have installed vim on ubuntu and configured it
- next session i am going to install all the reqs for the TriPort BackEnd
- i am then going to run the backend on ubuntu and try to run the frontend from Kali and have them talk to each other

- I do not code in days, I code in sessions
- because sometimes i get this strong feeling of not wanting to touch the computer at all
- i will also post some random stuff
- it is not going to be a super formal blog
- I just to be myself and keep things fun
