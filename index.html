  <h1>Welcome to My Blog 👋</h1>
  <p>Here, I share what I work on, what I learn, and some random thoughts. Purely for fun!</p>

    <h2>What I Am Currently Working On</h2>
    <p>I am big fan of Education. That is why I am building a School and Learning Management System, I call this Project TriPort</p>

    <h2>My Old 4GB RAM Beast 💻</h2>
    <p>I’ve got this old HP laptop. No screen. Will only boot when plugged in. Basically Frankenstein hardware.
    Tried Ubuntu Server... got humbled by its Wi‑Fi setup. So I switched to Ubuntu Desktop (overkill, but hey—I’ve got a monitor).</p>

    <h2>Why Self‑Hosting? 🌅</h2>
    <p>Checked AWS, GCP, Azure... needed a credit card. Mine’s expired. So I said “Screw it” and decided to host my projects myself. Purely for fun and because trips to the bank suck!</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Plan 🐧</h2>
    <p>Today I learned SSH between my HP (Ubuntu) and Kali. Straightforward and surprisingly fun. Next? Install requirements for the TriPort backend and test it from Kali. Pure hacker-style dev!</p>

    <h2>Why This Blog? ✍️</h2>
    <p>To track the grind. What I worked on, what I learned, what I’m tackling next. Pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. No overkill frameworks, no corporate vibes. Just a space for a guy with an old laptop and a love for coding. Let’s do this! 👊</p>
